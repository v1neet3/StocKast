It is the wisdom of the government. If we don\'t want the industry to grow and they are alright with a 5-6 percent growth, then I will not fiddle with their view,"" he said.In its 48th meeting last week, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, clarified the four requirements for applying the higher rate of compensation cess, which is 22 percent, to motor vehicles.According to the GST Council, cars with an engine capacity of more than 1,500cc, a length of more than 4,000mm, and a ground clearance of at least 170mm would be subject to a 22 percent cess. The council defined these vehicles as Sports Utility Vehicles or SUVs.The industry veteran emphasised that the regulatory burden was changing market behaviour, and for the healthy growth of the auto sector, the tax burden on small cars must be reduced.Also read:48th GST Council Meeting: No claim bonus to not be taxed under GST and other key takeawaysThe company\'s management said that the worst of the pandemic and chip shortage was over. ""We will have to live with the chip shortage for one or two years, but the worst is over,"" Bhargava said.Hisashi Takeuchi, MD of Maruti Suzuki,said the company is working on reducing CO2 emissions not just in terms of tailpipe emissions but across all aspects of manufacturing.""EV is a strong measure to reduce emissions, but Maruti Suzuki will look at all possible technologies good for India,"" he said.The new SUV models will come to the Auto Expo 2023 after the company unveiled the new Brezza and Grand Vitara.

FTA opens big export markets, and we can compete not through the dumping route but through our highly competitive products. India should aggressively go and reduce tariffs to increase automobile exports,"" he said.Bhargava, however, expressed concern about the slow pace of growth in India\'s manufacturing sector and said the government must look at ways to implement policies more effectively.Also read:These Maruti cars scored a measly 1-star safety rating in Global NCAP crash testContinue ReadingFirst Published:Dec 20, 2022 9:12 AMISTCheck out our in-depthMarket Coverage,Business News& get real-timeStock MarketUpdates on CNBC-TV18.
